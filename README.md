# ✍️ Inkr

**A distraction-free, writer-first creative suite — by authors, for authors.**

Inkr is your soon-to-be favorite place to write. It’s a clean, offline-friendly, no-fluff web editor that brings together the best of Reedsy, Scrivener, and NovelCrafter — without the paywalls or clutter.

> Because writing shouldn’t cost a truck-ton of money, and authors aren’t walking banks.

## 🧠 Why Inkr Exists

Most tools for writers are:
- Too expensive 💸
- Too clunky 🧱
- Or built by teams who’ve never touched a novel ✍️

Inkr is built by a real writer (me, hi!), for other writers who want something elegant, powerful, and affordable — *read: free*.

## 🧰 Tech Stack (Prototype)

- HTML + CSS + Vanilla JS
- Hosted on CodePen / GitHub Pages
- Markdown coming soon
- No frameworks yet - mainly because I don't know what those are yet.
